# To The Moon
This was a final project to the Intro to Computer Science course (ICS 111) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, instructed by Professor Jason Leigh. Students were tasked to make a simple game utilizing anything in the Java language and skills they have learned throughout the semester. This project was heavily inspired by Ketchapp's [Stack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.stack) game.

Project members were Andrew Obiano and Michelle Luu.
